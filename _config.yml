        description: |
            After a year of training in advanced electronics and networking, basic submarine training, and Sonar theory, I was stationed onboard the *USS Annapolis*. I quickly became accustomed to submarine life and soon earned my warfare designation, a/k/a **Dolphins**.

            Over the summer of 2011, I attended the Navy's SCUBA diving school in Panama City, Florida. There, I was certified as a SCUBA diver and Rescue Swimmer, and was awarded the Diver warfare designation. 

            While on an overseas deployment in 2012, I completed my qualifications for Sonar Supervisor. A prestigious qualification, and rare for one to complete during their first tour of duty, the Sonar Sup is overall responsible for the safety of the submarine while at-sea. As a Sonar Supervisor, I managed a team of 20 sailors, ensuring daily tasks and safety operations were executed efficiently. 

            My additional roles included qualifying as a QA work center supervisor, conducted SCUBA diving operations, served as the Ship's Calibration Program Coordinator, developed and led departmental trainng, and continuing to uphold standards of performance excellence and mission readiness.
