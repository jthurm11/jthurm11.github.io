            My tenure at General Dynamics Mission Systems showcases continuous professional growth driven by exceptional performance and recognition from my peers and superiors.

            Starting as a Software Integration Lead in December 2019, I demonstrated technical prowess by developing, installing, and managing clusters of Linux servers and networking equipment for a custom-built virtualization platform. My redesign of network routing for the system and of scripts managing virtual machine lifecycles significantly improved performance and collaboration. My contributions during challenging periods, including the COVID-19 pandemic, earned me the prestigious Presidentâ€™s Award for exceptional performance and dedication.

            In April 2021, I was promoted to Product Manager / Systems Technical Lead, where I led tasks related to software development, hardware testing, integration, documentation, and software demonstrations. My leadership extended to traveling to customer sites, overseeing system installations and surveys, and coordinating with industry partners to integrate applications within delivery timelines. My innovative creation of an emergency system power-off utility using Bash, along with developing procedures, technical drawings, and applications enhancing platform capability, reinforced my reputation as a reliable and innovative leader.

            In November 2022, I was promoted to Deputy Program Manager Engineering / Chief Engineer. In this role, I continued to lead my team of software engineers and logistics staff for in-service and new DoD-related projects. I am responsible for architecting and building the platform infrastructure, managing project scheduling, tasking, and risk management processes, and serving as the technical point of contact in internal and external meetings. Additionally, I have mentored and trained team members, fostering a culture of continuous learning and alignment with project objectives and timelines.

My contributions were acknowledged with the "Heavy Hitter" award.

        description: |
            After a year of training in advanced electronics and networking, basic submarine training, and Sonar theory, I was stationed onboard the *USS Annapolis*. I quickly became accustomed to submarine life and soon earned my warfare designation, a/k/a **Dolphins**.

            Over the summer of 2011, I attended the Navy's SCUBA diving school in Panama City, Florida. There, I was certified as a SCUBA diver and Rescue Swimmer, and was awarded the Diver warfare designation. 

            While on an overseas deployment in 2012, I completed my qualifications for Sonar Supervisor. A prestigious qualification, and rare for one to complete during their first tour of duty, the Sonar Sup is overall responsible for the safety of the submarine while at-sea. As a Sonar Supervisor, I managed a team of 20 sailors, ensuring daily tasks and safety operations were executed efficiently. 

            My additional roles included qualifying as a QA work center supervisor, conducted SCUBA diving operations, served as the Ship's Calibration Program Coordinator, developed and led departmental trainng, and continuing to uphold standards of performance excellence and mission readiness.

          Established in 1890 as Post College, Post is a private university in Waterbury, Connecticut. 
        description: | 
          With most of my general education completed through prior military education and a year studying at the University of Connecticut, I focused on core degree requirements at Post. By taking a mix of on-campus and online courses, plus attending summer semesters, I was able to complete my degree within 1.5 years. 
          
          Throughout my education here, I maintained a full-time job, commuting to campus in the afternoons after work.
